# MySQL / MariaDB functions test
Easy to test functions in MySQL / MariaDB.
(In my case I want to test CAST function)

## Prepare
After clone this project,
```
docker-compose up -d
```
when containers are ready, import test data into databases:

```
sh initial.sh
```
then you can try the functions with different database engines!
